DraftBois is an in-process 8-man fantasy-basketball website that combines elements of fantasy-basketball -- selecting line-ups to compete against opponents, cost-vs-benefit approach to filling out roster, and the ability to select different line-ups every day -- with elements of RPG games such as leveling up your profile, unlocking all 30 NBA rosters, and completing objectives to earn additional XP in order to create a more engaging experience.
